## installation

To build the library you have two options.

### Option 1: Docker

- **Requirements**: Docker installed
- **Build Library**
    - run the script `generate-archives-docker.sh`
    - it runs a docker container and builds the *mmlib* in it.
    - the created `dist`directory is copied back to repository root
    - it contains the `.whl` file that can used to install the library with pip (see below)
